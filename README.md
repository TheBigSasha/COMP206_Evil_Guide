# Rule #1: Never use the terminal!
[Use VSCode to connect to mimi](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh), and write all your code there :) If the prof gets mad, keep using VSCode on your computer and use a git reposiorty, then pull on mimi to never have to write any code on vim.

# Rule #2: Never use bash!
In Bash, it's valid to use Python code instead. Here's an example:

```bash
python << HEREDOC
print("hello from python")
```

# Rule #3: C is good, use it (but with a real IDE)!
For C, you can add the C VScode extension for code completion and syntax highlighting.
